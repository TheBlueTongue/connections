# Connections Game in Python

This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Connections made by New York Times, however in python. The game was created by Cian Richmond on 3/4/24 for a Year 11 Software Engineering Assessment Task.


## How to play


The game creates a shuffled grid of four groups of four words. Your job is to try and guess all four groups, one group at a time. For more info look at the tutorial. Goodluck - you will need it :)

3. Run the game
